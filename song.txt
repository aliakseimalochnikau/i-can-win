I think I have a problem
These blackened eyes are bloodshot
Lost like a fiend, I don't feel
What you feel for anyone or anything
Broken but I don't need, I don't need you to fix me
Numb to the pain, I could drown in the rain
My demons safe, kept in my grave

Drunk off mistakes, addicted to the everlasting hell
So I take another drink, throw up in the sink
The darker that it gets the easier I can breathe

If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me still I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
(That I'd become a crooked soul)

I see a devil in myself, inflicting all the grief and doubt
I don't feel (Feel anything)

Drunk off mistakes, addicted to the everlasting hell
So I take another drink, throw up in the sink
The darker it gets the easier I can breathe

If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me still I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
Don't need your help, time will tell
My only concern is myself
I always knew in the end
That I'd become a crooked soul

Don't need your help, time will tell, I see a devil in myself
I see a devil in myself
Lost like a fiend, I don't feel
What you feel
For anyone or anything

If I have a heart, why am I so cold?
If you love me still I don't feel it
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
Don't need your help, time will tell, my only concern is myself
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul
I always knew in the end that I'd become a crooked soul

Crooked soul
I see a devil in myself
